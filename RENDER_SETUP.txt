Render Setup (Backend 24/7)

Goal
Deploy the Node backend so it stays online 24/7.

Requirements
- A Git repo for this project (GitHub recommended)
- Render account

Step-by-step
1) Push to GitHub
   - Create a GitHub repo and push this project.
   - The backend lives in the `backend` folder.

2) Create a Web Service on Render
   - Go to https://render.com → Dashboard → New + → Web Service.
   - Connect your GitHub repo and select the repo.

3) Configure the service
   - Name: accountability-backend (or anything you want)
   - Region: closest to you
   - Branch: main (or your default)
   - Root Directory: backend
   - Build Command: npm install
   - Start Command: node server.js

4) Set environment variables
   - JWT_SECRET: set a strong random string
   - PORT: leave blank (Render injects PORT automatically)

5) Deploy
   - Click Create Web Service.
   - Wait for the build to finish.
   - Your backend URL will look like:
     https://your-service-name.onrender.com

6) Test the backend
   - Visit the URL in a browser.
   - You should see:
     {"message":"Accountability Backend API","status":"running","version":"1.0.0"}

7) Update your apps to use the new backend URL
   - Child agent: set SERVER_URL to the Render URL
   - Parent app: update its API/base URL to the Render URL

Notes about persistence
- Render’s filesystem resets on each deploy.
- Right now the backend stores data in:
  - account.txt (login)
  - backend-data.json (pairings/devices)
- On Render, these files will reset to the repo version after a redeploy.
- If you want true persistence, I can update the backend to read/write
  to a mounted disk path (Render “Persistent Disk”).

Optional: Add a persistent disk (if you want data to survive deploys)
- In Render, open the service → Disks → Add Disk.
- Mount path example: /var/data
- Then I can update the backend to store:
  - /var/data/account.txt
  - /var/data/backend-data.json
